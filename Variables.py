Variables----These are used to store a single value

Rules for defining Variables
============================================
1) Variable names must start with a letter or underscore
example: a=10, _a=2

2) Variable Names are case-sensitive

x=5
X=5

x and X are not same in python

3) Numbers and underscores can exist at later stages of the variable name except at the beginning underscore is allowed
